Frontend Academy: Designers meet code! 🎉

## Static HTML & CSS

When running locally, to start the static HTML & CSS server:

- `npm install` (this needs to be run only once!)

- Open `http://localhost:3000`

Now you can edit files under `./static` and you should see the changes reflected in the browser immediately.
